  <div class="caption"> The Super Bowl has averaged nearly <a href= https://www.statista.com/statistics/216526/super-bowl-us-tv-viewership/> 100 million viewers</a> per year over the past two decades, making it the most watched standalone broadcast in America anually. </div>

<div class="story">

<p> Los Angeles, C.A. - Following the Los Angeles Rams’ 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI, Nielsen announced that over 99 million Americans tuned in to watch the big game. This marks the 17th consecutive Super Bowl broadcast to cross the 90 million threshold, with 10 of the 17 having eclipsed the 100 million viewer mark.
<p>
It’s no secret that the Super Bowl is typically the most watched single broadcast by the U.S. every year, but the massive ratings have a more widespread impact than the typical viewer recognizes. Beyond the watch parties and elite athletic display, the Super Bowl serves as the single largest day for advertisement in America. 
<p>
This is because the pure exposure that occurs when seemingly all of America is in front of TV for the big game is unrivaled. Not only does the Super Bowl signify an elite opportunity for companies to promote themselves and their products, but it also serves as a way for the largest of these companies to set trends with how they collectively attack their campaigns. 
<p>
“Super Bowl commercials are meant to make a splash in a specific moment in time (the weeks running up to and including the Super Bowl), so unlike most other advertising, they try very hard to reflect the specific cultural, political and social environment at that specific time,” said Brian Sheehan, an advertisement professor at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School.
<p>
Between 2000-2020, there were a handful of noticeable changes as well as constants from the advertisers who aired the most commercials – specifically the ten that aired the most ads since during that time span.
<p>
Data intervals varying over the past two decades help us understand how consumers are being targeted, but they also can point towards culture shifts. One example of this would be spikes in patriotic commercials during times of conflict between the U.S. and any foreign entities. 
<p>
In the past few years alone, one of the biggest jumps we’ve seen regarding Super Bowl advertisements has been the increase in celebrity cameos. As the most relevant companies have continued growing financially, they have all used higher funding to enlist celebrities for their promotions. 
<p>
“Celebrity use is at a crest right now in Super Bowl commercials. Our society is celebrity and influencer obsessed at the moment,” Sheehan says. “Celebrity use leads to further publicity around the commercial and allows the brands to leverage that celebrity’s social media network.”
<p>
The concerted effort to secure celebrities for commercials is a mutually beneficial development that helps the celebrities themselves financially and with additional publicity. The trend reached its apex in 2020, with every single ad front the top 10 most common companies who air during the big game featuring a celebrity.

<p>
On the opposite end of the spectrum, the ten aforementioned companies that aired the most ads since 2000 have completely gone away from sexual advertising methods. After a steady dosage of promiscuous commercials through the mid 2010s, there was an absence of these style of ads from 2015-2020. This particular trend is another example of how cultural norms are reflected in the promotion strategies used during the Super Bowl and in general.
<p>

<p>
The disappearance of sexual ads can likely be attributed to the ever-growing feminist cause and companies wanting to steer clear of controversy. Furthermore, the #MeToo campaign’s growing prominence in the latter part of the past decade has created a new tone around how sexuality is approached in pop culture.
<p>
But just as valuable as it is to analyze the changes in Super Bowl commercials over time, it is equally important to notice what has stayed the same. And for the companies that put out the most advertisements, there was one style of promotion that was hammered home: humor. 
<p>
Seven of the ten most frequent advertisers during the big game employed humor more than any other device for their ads. Bud Light, Doritos, and E-Trade all used humor in over 90% of their commercials since 2000.
<p>
This should come as no surprise, however, as humor has historically been one of the most effective tools in promotion. 
<p>
“Humor is an effective way to make ads more appealing and memorable in general and is particularly well attuned to the party atmosphere of the Super Bowl,” Sheehan says.”
<p>

  <iframe title="For the past 20 years, comedy has been king in Super Bowl commercials" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-FkgY4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FkgY4/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="518" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

<br>

<p>
The ability of humor to capture audience attention, specifically during a Super Bowl environment, makes its prevalence easy to understand.
<p>
While this data set is far from predictive, we can assume that past trends like humor and celebrity appearances will be steadfast in their relevance for the reasons Sheehan mentions. 
<p>
As consumers, we typically don’t pay attention to these commercial patterns in the moment, so looking at the data in hindsight allows us to become more aware of the methods taken to ensure our engagement with some of the largest corporations in the world – as well as how said corporations influence their smaller counterparts.
